# Ray Tracer Project Page

A ray tracer implemented in C++. It traverses a scene graph described by lua scripts.
This was written for an assignment for the CS 488 course at the University of Waterloo.

Check out the [site](http://0ctobyte.github.io/raytracer/) to see some of the images rendered with
the ray tracer!
